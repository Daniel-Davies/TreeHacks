Hello,

I currently have a small issue with getting to work; unfortunately, the DVLA has revoked my licence while they review my medical condition. I have provided them with my details, however while things are being sorted, I currently have no driving licence, so can't get to work. I was therefore wondering whether you could ask some of my colleagues at work (who live nearby) whether they would be willing to pick me up/ drop me off to work with them?

Many Thanks,

Jadwiga Davies
